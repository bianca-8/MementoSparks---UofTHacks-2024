<h2>Inspiration</h2>
We were inspired by us forgetting our own good memories, Memento Spark will allow us to remember them for the future. We also got inspiration from paper diaries and scrap books, but since those can be lost or damaged, along with the memories stored in them, we wanted to create a digital version of those where the memories will never be lost!

<h2>What it does</h2>
Memento Spark allows you to save your memories through text, images and audio. It can be treated as a diary, a photo album, or even just a place you want to store memories to remember for the future. The user can look through all their past memories they logged to remember and live through their past memories again.

<h2>How we built it</h2>
Memento Spark was built using Django for all the files, Python for back-end and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
Hosting the dynamic website on the .Tech domain was a challenge since none of us had done that before. We also tried hosting our website on other platforms, but many were blocked by paywalls. It was also a challenge to integrate the sponsor platforms into our code such as Auth0, and we were originally going to use Taipy as well but it was too complex.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
We are proud of finishing the project in the short amount of time given. It is also a fully-functional demo that is ready to present. Also, creating the start of a project that has lots of potential in the future.

<h2>What we learned</h2>
UfTHacks is the first hackathon for the majority of the group, so participating in it was a very fun learning experience. We learned about effective collaboration, time management and problem-solving under time constraints. We also tried a lot of new things in our project such as hosting on a .Tech domain, connecting front-end and back-end together, and using Django.

<h2>What's next for Memento Spark</h2>
Allowing users to share their memories with friends, family and those who shared the memory with them, which will provide greater connection in lives. Also adding file compatibility with videos, to preserve more diverse memories.
